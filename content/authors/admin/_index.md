I am a master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am working closely with Esmaeil Seraj in CORE Robotic Lab, supervised by Prof. Matthew Gombolay. My research interests mainly covers: multi-agent reinforcement learning, reinforcement learning, learning from deemostration, robotic control and machine learning.

Previously, I recevied my B.S. Degree from Tianjin Universtiy. At that time, I was a member in the group directed by Prof. Xiaodong Zhang, mainly focus the research topic for automatic component defect detection with machine vision methods.
